# Workflow
Workflow Repo
### Requirements
1. [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/install)
3. [GIT](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
### Installation
1. Clone the repository
```npm
git clone https://github.com/HackMort/Workflow.git
```
2. Install the dependencies
```npm
npm install
```
3. Install SASS globally (you may need to run this command as an administrator/sudo)
```npm
npm install -g sass
```
4. Run the live server
```npm
npm run dev
```
5. This will open a new browser window with the project running on http://127.0.0.1:8080/ and will automatically update when you make changes to the code.
6. Enjoy!

### Development
1. The project uses [BEM](http://getbem.com/introduction/) for naming conventions.
2. The project uses [standardJS](https://standardjs.com/) for code formatting.
